#### Experience Testing

This application includes a UI test for the application experience written in Python, using Selenium, that you can extend as you further develop your application.

To run the experience test, first you need to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system.

Then install selenium.
```bash
pip install selenium
```
[Set up the Chrome WebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) on your system, you will also need to install the [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you do not have it. If you prefer, you can update the experience test experience_test.py to use the [Firefox WebDriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver). Make sure that you have added the driver to your system PATH.

With the application running locally, export the necessary environment variables, and run the Python web experience test in this directory.
```bash
export APP_URL=https://localhost:3000 # default value for the local application
python3 experience_test.py
```
